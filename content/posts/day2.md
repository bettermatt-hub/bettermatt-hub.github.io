Today was a bit less eventful, tryhackme was down most of the time I was attempting to work on it and I had family engagements through the afternoon anyways but I've been going through the [free path](https://tryhackme.com/r/resources/blog/free_path) and got through the Linux lessons, which posed no challenge as I've been using Linux as my daily for months now in anticipation of a new career path. 

The OHsint challenge was fun, using Google to look up information on a fictional character using their social media and blog posts. 

I'm excited to start getting into the tools tomorrow!
