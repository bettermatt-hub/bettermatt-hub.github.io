Today I got into it, learning the nmmap flags and playing around with password cracking using Hydra. 

One thing that I really enjoy is just how wide the field is and how no matter how much you learn, there's always more to learn, new technology, new frontiers. Especially with how things are going concerning AI and technology, I don't think there's a better time to work on self improvement and developing important skills!
